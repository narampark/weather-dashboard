# <Weather Dashboard>

## Description

This project was done to create a weather dashboard using the openweathermap API, favicon, and bootstrap to dynamically change the HTML to display the current weather and 5 day forecast for a city the user searches. When the user inputs a city name into the search bar and submits it, the current weather and future forecast gets populated on to the webpage and the search history will be saved into the dropdown bar underneath the search bar. The weather data displayed consists of the city name, date/day, a weather icon indicating the weather, temperature in fahrenheit and celcius, humidity, and the wind speed. It functions by calling on the geocoding API through openweathermap.org to get the latitude and longitude of the inputted city and then passing that data to the weather data API and getting the current and future forecast for that city.
